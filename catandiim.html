                    <h3>Good time to start preparing?</h3>
                    <p> While some start preparing as early as February, but an ideal time to start preparation is
                        around the end of July.
                        Most coaching institutes start crash-courses at this time designed specifically for IIT
                        students. </p><br>
                    <h3>Best way to study?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The usual way of studying is learning the concepts and then giving practice tests. However,
                            for CAT preparation,
                            it is the other way around. Giving full mock tests and analysing them will provide an
                            excellent picture of your
                            present standing. Accordingly, you can focus on the type of questions which need attention.
                            A much lengthier method
                            of prep would be working on understanding and perfecting all theory first and then giving
                            mock tests, which is not advisable.</li>
                        <li>Another way to improve your verbal and reading comprehension skills is to read a book a
                            week. Force yourself to read a lot and then write a review, to make sure you understand what
                            you have read.</li>

                        took the test twice didn’t prepare seriously for their first attempt.
                        Take away message, CAT is not very difficult for our college crowd, with some preparation you
                        can certainly crack, if not ace the exam. </p>

                        and
                        your CV is shortlisted by professors and sometimes even students of that school.
                        Thus it is advisable to reach out to IITB alums in your targeted B-Schools to understand the
                        shortlisting process. <br><br>
                        The panel looks for excellent ambassadors of their institute and mainly people who can add
                        unique value to the student community. In the end, networking with a diverse
                        set of people is one important offering of any B-School and they keep that in mind during the
                        recruitment process. <br><br>
                        The kind of questions asked in the interview vary depending on the panel and the school, the
                        panel may test your undergraduate interns, business and general awareness
                        (typical IIMA style) or they may be interested in your work experience and personal interests
                        (typical IIM B style).
                    </p>

                    <h3>What before Personal Interviews?</h3>
                    <p>You’ll have your <strong>AWT (Analytical Writing Test: in IIM A)</strong> or the <strong>WAT
                            (Written Ability Test: in other IIMs)</strong> a.k.a. </strong>The essays.</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AWT and WAT fundamentally test how well you can present your thoughts in writing. In IIM A’s
                            AWT, you will have to analyse a 3 paragraph newspaper-like article, and in the other IIMs
                            WAT, you will have to write about a small topic which will be briefed in 2-3 lines for the
                            sake of clarity.</li>
                        <li>You will be given 15-20 mins for the test. The focus of assessment here is how well you back
                            your views up with your analysis and arguments. The language, while not expected to be
                            flowery- should be grammatically correct (the basic hygiene). </li>
                        <li>Revati Rajput from IIMA says,</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The above selection process is common across all major B-schools in India: IIMs, ISBs and XLRI.
                        There are coaches (institutes) who can train you for this phase of the selection process.
                        Coaching institutes like T.I.M.E and Career Launcher provide focussed training to students who
                        have successfully reached this stage through mock interviews and mock AWT/WAT. <strong>
                            These coaching institutes also offer special workshops and fee discounts exclusively for
                            IITians, giving us an edge over others.</strong>

                    <h3>What is the best way to prepare for the PI? </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by asking yourself some of the possible questions and answering them honestly; you can
                            also make various buckets, namely academics, work experience, finance,
                            current affairs, extracurriculars and personal characteristics for the same.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reading newspapers and relevant web articles will help you keep yourself abreast of all the
                            major current affairs which will also help in essays and group discussions,
                            about which we’ll talk in the next paragraph ‘What before Personal Interviews’.</li>
                        <li>Considering the interview questions can also be based on what you’ve studied so far, Hamza
                            Najmi from IIM Kozhikode advises (especially for freshers applying to B School), </li>
                    </ul>
                    <img style="display: flex; margin: auto;" src="./assets/images/quotes/q7.png" alt="Quote" width=76%><br>
                    <p>
                        Important to note that IIMs don’t have <strong>group discussion (GD)</strong> as a part of their
                        selection process, but it is an integral part of the selection process of many other top
                        B-schools like XLRI. It is an understated fact, but it is vital to keep your calm and put forth
                        your arguments confidently.
                        You can join <em>facebook preparation groups or make preparation groups with your friends for
                            regular group discussions.</em></p>
