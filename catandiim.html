                                <li>Considered the most challenging section of CAT, is time-consuming and has confusing

                                <li>Has 32 questions approximately</li>

                                    break into the 99 percentile bracket. Thus, it is also considered as a make-or-break

                    <h3>Good time to start preparing?</h3> <br>
                    <p> While some start preparing as early as February, but an ideal time to start preparation is
                        around the end of July. Most coaching institutes start crash-courses at this time designed
                        specifically for IIT students. </p><br>

                    <h3>Best way to study?</h3> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The usual way of studying is learning the concepts and then giving practice tests. However,
                            for CAT preparation, it is the other way around. Giving full mock tests and analysing them
                            will provide an excellent picture of your present standing. Accordingly, you can focus on
                            the type of questions which need attention. A much lengthier method of prep would be working
                            on understanding and perfecting all theory first and then giving mock tests, which is not
                            advisable.</li>
                        <li>Another way to improve your verbal and reading comprehension skills is to read a book a
                            week. Force yourself to read a lot and then write a review, to make sure you understand what
                            you have read.</li>
                        <li>Some tips for CAT preparation - Shubham Singhal from IIMA says:</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <blockquote> The strategy I followed was to give a lot of mock tests and also review the mock tests.
                        I tried to identify areas where my answers are wrong and which areas I am spending too much time
                        on. For subject-wise strategy - Quant: try to solve questions without pen and paper, and to make
                        a conscious attempt to do mental math which helps in increasing speed. For DI LR: solve a
                        variety of questions. For Verbal Reading and comprehending quickly, practice reading a lot of
                        articles, books and newspapers for increasing reading speed. <footer>— Shubham Singal, IIMA

                        not very difficult for our college crowd, with some preparation you can certainly crack, if not
                        ace the exam. </p> <br>

                    <p><br>Starting with Personal interview (PI): The interview panel are Professors of that B-school,
                        and your CV is shortlisted by professors and sometimes even students of that school. Thus it is
                        advisable to reach out to IITB alums in your targeted B-Schools to understand the shortlisting
                        process. <br><br>

                        The panel looks for excellent ambassadors of their institute and mainly people who can add
                        unique value to the student community. In the end, networking with a diverse set of people is
                        one important offering of any B-School and they keep that in mind during the recruitment
                        process. <br><br>

                        The kind of questions asked in the interview vary depending on the panel and the school, the
                        panel may test your undergraduate interns, business and general awareness (typical IIMA style)
                        or they may be interested in your work experience and personal interests (typical IIMB style).

                    <h3>What before Personal Interviews?</h3> <br>

                    <p>You’ll have your <strong>AWT (Analytical Writing Test: in IIM A)</strong> or the <strong>WAT
                            (Written Ability Test: in other IIMs)</strong> a.k.a. </strong>The essays.</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>AWT and WAT fundamentally test how well you can present your thoughts in writing. In IIM A’s
                            AWT, you will have to analyse a 3 paragraph newspaper-like article, and in the other IIMs
                            WAT, you will have to write about a small topic which will be briefed in 2-3 lines for the
                            sake of clarity.</li>
                        <li>You will be given 15-20 mins for the test. The focus of assessment here is how well you back
                            your views up with your analysis and arguments. The language, while not expected to be
                            flowery - should be grammatically correct (the basic hygiene). </li>

                        frameworks helped me structure my thoughts better and write concisely during the final test,

                        There are coaches (institutes) who can train you for this phase of the selection process.
                        Coaching institutes like T.I.M.E and Career Launcher provide focussed training to students who
                        have successfully reached this stage through mock interviews and mock AWT/WAT. <strong> These
                            coaching institutes also offer special workshops and fee discounts exclusively for IITians,

                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by asking yourself some of the possible questions and answering them honestly; you can
                            also make various buckets, namely academics, work experience, finance, current affairs,
                            extracurriculars and personal characteristics for the same. </li>

                        <li>Reading newspapers and relevant web articles will help you keep yourself abreast of all the
                            major current affairs which will also help in essays and group discussions, about which
                            we’ll talk in the next paragraph ‘What before Personal Interviews’.</li>

                        <li>Considering the interview questions can also be based on what you’ve studied so far, Hamza
                            Najmi from IIM Kozhikode advises (especially for freshers applying to B School): </li>

                    <p> Important to note that IIMs don’t have <strong>group discussion (GD)</strong> as a part of their
                        selection process, but it is an integral part of the selection process of many other top
                        B-schools like XLRI. It is an understated fact, but it is vital to keep your calm and put forth
                        your arguments confidently. You can join <em>facebook preparation groups or make preparation
                            groups with your friends for regular group discussions.</em></p> <br><br>
