                            India take CAT (Common Admission Test) scores and some take GMAT (Graduate
                            Management Admission Test). Timeline for the CAT exam is given in flowchart-1:

                                <li>Reading comprehension takes up to 70% of this section; there are usually five
                                    passages in this section with mostly MCQ and a few Type in the Answer (TITA).</li>
                                <li>Verbal ability is a relatively small subsection containing questions on paragraph

                                <li>Has 32 questions approximately</li>

                                    section can be relatively easy. One only needs to solve 16 questions correctly to
                                    break into the 99 percentile bracket. Thus, it is also considered as a make-or-break

                    <h3>Good time to start preparing?</h3>
                    <p> While some start preparing as early as February, but an ideal time to start preparation is
                        around the end of July.
                        Most coaching institutes start crash-courses at this time designed specifically for IIT
                        students. </p><br>
                    <h3>Best way to study?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The usual way of studying is learning the concepts and then giving practice tests. However,
                            for CAT preparation,
                            it is the other way around. Giving full mock tests and analysing them will provide an
                            excellent picture of your
                            present standing. Accordingly, you can focus on the type of questions which need attention.
                            A much lengthier method
                            of prep would be working on understanding and perfecting all theory first and then giving
                            mock tests, which is not advisable.</li>
                        <li>Another way to improve your verbal and reading comprehension skills is to read a book a
                            week. Force yourself to read a lot and then write a review, to make sure you understand what
                            you have read.</li>

                        width=96%><br>
                    <p>Most people who were interviewed cleared the CAT in their first attempt, and many of those who
                        took the test twice didn’t prepare seriously for their first attempt.
                        Take away message, CAT is not very difficult for our college crowd, with some preparation you
                        can certainly crack, if not ace the exam. </p>
                    <h3>What After CAT? </h3>
                    <h5>For IIMs</h5>
                    <p>Continuing the flow chart from ‘Everything about CAT section’:</p>
                    <br><img src="" alt="Flowchart-2" width=96%><br>
                    <p>Starting with Personal interview (PI): The interview panel are Professors of that B-school, and
                        your CV is shortlisted by professors and sometimes even students of that school.
                        Thus it is advisable to reach out to IITB alums in your targeted B-Schools to understand the
                        shortlisting process. <br><br>
                        The panel looks for excellent ambassadors of their institute and mainly people who can add
                        unique value to the student community. In the end, networking with a diverse
                        set of people is one important offering of any B-School and they keep that in mind during the
                        recruitment process. <br><br>
                        The kind of questions asked in the interview vary depending on the panel and the school, the
                        panel may test your undergraduate interns, business and general awareness
                        (typical IIMA style) or they may be interested in your work experience and personal interests
                        (typical IIM B style).
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the best way to prepare for the PI? </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by asking yourself some of the possible questions and answering them honestly; you can
                            also make various buckets, namely academics, work experience, finance,
                            current affairs, extracurriculars and personal characteristics for the same.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reading newspapers and relevant web articles will help you keep yourself abreast of all the
                            major current affairs which will also help in essays and group discussions,
                            about which we’ll talk in the next paragraph ‘What before Personal Interviews’.</li>
                        <li>Considering the interview questions can also be based on what you’ve studied so far, Hamza
                            Najmi from IIM Kozhikode advises (especially for freshers applying to B School), </li>

                            AWT, you will have to analyse a 3 paragraph newspaper-like article, and in the other IIMs
                            WAT, you will have to write about a small topic which will be briefed in 2-3 lines for the
                            sake of clarity.</li>
                        <li>You will be given 15-20 mins for the test. The focus of assessment here is how well you back
                            your views up with your analysis and arguments. The language, while not expected to be
                            flowery- should be grammatically correct (the basic hygiene). </li>

                    <p>The above selection process is common across all major B-schools in India: IIMs, ISBs and XLRI.
                        There are coaches (institutes) who can train you for this phase of the selection process.
                        Coaching institutes like T.I.M.E and Career Launcher provide focussed training to students who
                        have successfully reached this stage through mock interviews and mock AWT/WAT. <strong>
                            These coaching institutes also offer special workshops and fee discounts exclusively for
                            IITians, giving us an edge over others.</strong><br><br>
                        Important to note that IIMs don’t have <strong>group discussion (GD)</strong> as a part of their
                        selection process, but it is an integral part of the selection process of many other top
                        B-schools like XLRI. It is an understated fact, but it is vital to keep your calm and put forth
                        your arguments confidently.

                    <h3>1. IIM Ahmedabad</h3>
                    <p>IIM A has been the top-ranked MBA school in India and probably the most difficult to get a call
                        from and get admission
                        into. The cohort is younger compared to that of IIMB, with higher numbers of freshers in a
                        class, nearly 140
                        students(almost 35% of class) out of the class size of nearly 400 students.</p>
                    <p>If you want to understand admission criteria for IIMA (based on CAT 2020 results) you can check
                        out how they calculate
                        the cumulative score. It takes into account previous degree type, grades school, college and
                        work-experience <a
                            href="https://www.iima.ac.in/web/pgp/apply/domestic/admission/selection-process"

                            institute gives different weights to different parameters. This information can be found on
                            their respective websites.
                            It is recommended that you check these parameters for your target schools to estimate your
                            chances of selection</strong>.</p>
                    <p>As per our interviews, we found that A is more academically rigorous than B and C. Some may say
                        it is better to be a big
                        fish in a small pond than a small fish in a larger one. Given the higher ranking of IIM A, it
                        attracts many highly
                        talented individuals which in turn means higher competition during placements. Thus, the same
                        person can get slightly
                        better placement opportunities at B and C because of marginally less competition. But
                        <strong>Revati Rajput</strong> from IIMA says,
                        <i>"Talking about IIM-A, the stiff competition does nothing but enriches your experience.
                            Opportunities are not to be
                            offered but created for yourself. As they say, if you can survive at IIM-A, you can survive
                            anywhere in the world."</i> <strong> Vaibhav Nehete</strong> about IIMA says, <i>"Almost all
                            your peers at IIMs are destined
                            to be at the top
                            position of any corporate
                            firm or of their own firm. Hence networking opportunities are immense at IIMA and can really
                            help you out in your future
                            as well. Placement opportunities at IIMA are immense. Over 160+ companies come to recruit
                            400 people."</i></p>

                    <h3>2. IIM Bangalore</h3>
                    <p>Average work ex of students at IIM B is slightly higher than that of A since B is more inclined
                        to get candidates with
                        some work experience than A and C. Number of students in the batch is nearly 400. IIM-B uniquely
                        provides a student with
                        foreign opportunities compared to other IIMs that tend to have fewer placements abroad. IIM-B
                        has almost 5% foreign
                        placements, which may seem low, but when compared to other IIMs that have less than 1% foreign
                        placements, the
                        proportion is high for IIM-B.</p>
                    <p>Also, IIMB asks for two LORs and one SOP also at the time of admission, which is not asked by A
                        and C, the referencer
                        will have to give the information before the interview round. LOR can be from your employer or
                        professor: professors
                        will give good LORs. The advice here is to maintain good relationships with IIT professors.</p>
                    <p>IIMB has also started PGP in business Analytics this year, it is a 2 years program with batch
                        size of 46 people.</p>

                    <h3>3. IIM Calcutta</h3>
                    <p>IIM Calcutta is renowned for its finance specialisation. That is not to say that it lacks in its
                        other specialisations.
                        The top 3 IIMs, namely IIM A, B and C offer similar placement opportunities. They have an
                        equally good reputation in the
                        industry. The number of students in the batch is approximately 460.</p>
                    <p>The opportunities are similar across the top three IIMs. With IIM B eyeing primarily students
                        with work experience, you
                        as a fresh graduate will likely be deciding whether to choose IIM Ahmedabad or Calcutta.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rachil Maliwal</strong> who had job experience in Citi Bank decided to go to IIM C
                        because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, because Calcutta is the finance campus, with a large number of core finance roles
                            being offered.</li>
                        <li>Secondly, academic rigour in Ahmedabad is very intense. Attendance rules, daily class
                            preparation in Calcutta is
                            relatively relaxed.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, Ahmedabad admits students with impeccable academic records. Calcutta is a bit more
                            forgiving of students' past
                            mistakes. This also plays into your relative standing in the institute, and securing a good
                            internship becomes easier in
                            Calcutta than in Ahmedabad.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One thing unique to IIM Calcutta is the <strong>PGD in Business Analytics</strong>, a course that
                        is jointly
                        offered by ISI, IIT
                        Kharagpur and IIM C; you can get to know more about the program through their <a

                    <p>Sure, IIMK is not seen at par with IIM A, B, C, Lucknow and ISB in terms of reputation and
                        opportunities by IIT
                        students. Still, being one of the older IIMs, its vast alumni network ensures excellent
                        placements which can’t be
                        called, “not good”, by any standards. The number of students in the batch is nearly 480.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IIMK has recently started attracting some leading private equity and multiple Alternate

                        <li>IIMK has always been renowned for the quality job offers in the marketing vertical. And on

                            couldn’t crack the sought after top IIMs or ISB.</li>

                            Institutional Ranking Framework) rating, IIM L is at
                            the 4th position, so it has got a good reputation. It is pretty good, but the proportion of
                            students from the top IITs
                            is small, which has its pros and cons though IITians are given special treatment here.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is the 4th oldest IIM and most companies that go to ABC come to L too, so placement chances
                        are relatively better for
                        the same roles. The number of students in the batch is roughly 400.</p>

                        despite the fees of the
                        programme being least amongst these 8 B-schools. It also has the highest proportion of freshers

                            year of the Programme. They are required to
                            carry out a study on various industries and key players in the industry. This enhances their
                            exposure to organisations
                            and provides them with a backdrop for analysing the managerial contexts of different cases.
