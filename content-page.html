                            already decided to apply for Business Schools in India. In that case, this guide might be useful for you.
                            This guide is a product of a collaboration between Insight and an IIT B alumna, Prachi Chavda, from the class of 
                            2017. The conception of this guidebook has an interesting story behind it. If we may (we won’t mind if you skip to the next paragraph :-) )

                                On 5th March 2020, a few days before the COVID-19 lockdown, Prachi was travelling for work, and her flight was delayed by a couple of hours. 
                                By some coincidence, a girl wearing an H10 hoodie was sitting right next to her, so in order to kill time, they talked for hours. During the 
                                course of that conversation, Prachi realised how lost the sophomore was, like herself at that stage, not fully knowing the opportunities available 
                                in and after college or even whom to approach for guidance. Inspired to bridge the knowledge gap, Prachi decided to do her research. In May 2020, she 
                                reached out to Insight with this idea to pen down learnings from various alumni. To begin with, Prachi wanted to add,

                            This guide focuses on Business Management Programs, mainly MBA since it is the most popular management degree. 
                            We plan to release the guide in two parts, the first part (this one) covers relevant information regarding management 
                            programs in India. We have covered eight schools - IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Kozhikode, 
                            IIM Indore, IIM Lucknow, ISB (Hyderabad and Mohali) and XLRI (Jamshedpur) for analysis and interviews and FMS Delhi. 
                            We will soon release the next part, extensively covering information about management programs in foreign schools. We 
                            have collected information from reliable online resources and reached out to 100+ IIT B alumni from the listed B-Schools, 
                            to make this mini-guide as diverse and credible as possible.

                        <p><i> If each of us asked ourselves why we chose IIT, many of us might answer “my parents asked (read: forced) 
                            me to give JEE” as we were very young and did not know any better. Approaching graduation, most of us 
                            face the ‘problem of plenty’ - accepting placement offers, applying for higher studies, pursuing an MBA, 
                            or doing something unconventional. While many options may exist, they fall into two broad categories - 
                            ‘research and academia’ or ‘the corporate path to success’. Suppose you do end up (whether pre-planned or not) with
                             a job. In that case, it is highly probable that you would ask yourself these questions sooner or later in life- “should 
                             I do a Management course or not?” and “should I give CAT/GMAT or not?”.
                            </i>
                            <br>
                            Quite often, people apply for IIMs after their graduation if they are not able to secure their dream job in a 
                            particular stream. Many believe that an MBA would boost their salary and enhance their chances of pursuing the 
                            profile that they desire. While this may be true to some extent, prior job experience greatly helps in securing 
                            an internship in a B-School. The summer placement, as it is called, is just five months into the start of most 
                            MBA programs. A fresher’s CV is judged mostly based on the UG CPI and previous internship(s) experience. Moreover, 
                            failing to secure the right internship during the MBA can hinder good placements later. Thus freshers find it challenging 
                            to secure top placements in most B-Schools, thus resulting in a cycle. Most alumni that we contacted were against the 
                            idea of joining a B-School just after graduation. When asked <strong>“How many years of work experience did you have before MBA?”  
                            and “What according to you is the advisable number of years of pre-MBA work experience?”</strong>, (we plotted the answers as infographic-1) we can see that :
