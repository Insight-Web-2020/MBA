                            already decided to apply for Business Schools in India. In that case, this guide might be useful for you.
                            This guide is a product of a collaboration between Insight and an IIT B alumna, Prachi Chavda, from the class of 
                            2017. The conception of this guidebook has an interesting story behind it. If we may (we won’t mind if you skip to the next paragraph :-) )

                                On 5th March 2020, a few days before the COVID-19 lockdown, Prachi was travelling for work, and her flight was delayed by a couple of hours. 
                                By some coincidence, a girl wearing an H10 hoodie was sitting right next to her, so in order to kill time, they talked for hours. During the 
                                course of that conversation, Prachi realised how lost the sophomore was, like herself at that stage, not fully knowing the opportunities available 
                                in and after college or even whom to approach for guidance. Inspired to bridge the knowledge gap, Prachi decided to do her research. In May 2020, she 
                                reached out to Insight with this idea to pen down learnings from various alumni. To begin with, Prachi wanted to add,

                            This guide focuses on Business Management Programs, mainly MBA since it is the most popular management degree. 
                            We plan to release the guide in two parts, the first part (this one) covers relevant information regarding management 
                            programs in India. We have covered eight schools - IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta, IIM Kozhikode, 
                            IIM Indore, IIM Lucknow, ISB (Hyderabad and Mohali) and XLRI (Jamshedpur) for analysis and interviews and FMS Delhi. 
                            We will soon release the next part, extensively covering information about management programs in foreign schools. We 
                            have collected information from reliable online resources and reached out to 100+ IIT B alumni from the listed B-Schools, 
                            to make this mini-guide as diverse and credible as possible.

                        <p><i> If each of us asked ourselves why we chose IIT, many of us might answer “my parents asked (read: forced) 
                            me to give JEE” as we were very young and did not know any better. Approaching graduation, most of us 
                            face the ‘problem of plenty’ - accepting placement offers, applying for higher studies, pursuing an MBA, 
                            or doing something unconventional. While many options may exist, they fall into two broad categories - 
                            ‘research and academia’ or ‘the corporate path to success’. Suppose you do end up (whether pre-planned or not) with
                             a job. In that case, it is highly probable that you would ask yourself these questions sooner or later in life- “should 
                             I do a Management course or not?” and “should I give CAT/GMAT or not?”.
                            </i>
                            <br><br>
                            Quite often, people apply for IIMs after their graduation if they are not able to secure their dream job in a 
                            particular stream. Many believe that an MBA would boost their salary and enhance their chances of pursuing the 
                            profile that they desire. While this may be true to some extent, prior job experience greatly helps in securing 
                            an internship in a B-School. The summer placement, as it is called, is just five months into the start of most 
                            MBA programs. A fresher’s CV is judged mostly based on the UG CPI and previous internship(s) experience. Moreover, 
                            failing to secure the right internship during the MBA can hinder good placements later. Thus freshers find it challenging 
                            to secure top placements in most B-Schools, thus resulting in a cycle. Most alumni that we contacted were against the 
                            idea of joining a B-School just after graduation. When asked <b>“How many years of work experience did you have before MBA?”  
                            and “What according to you is the advisable number of years of pre-MBA work experience?”</b>, (we plotted the answers as infographic-1) we can see that :

                        <li>For finance, the majority recommend 2-3 years of experience before MBA.

                            Looking at infographic-2, one might wonder why MBAs cost as much as they do, and why they are so sought after
                             when most people could get a decent package after 2-3 years of job experience. We asked the same to many IIT-B 
                             alumni, and the answers helped us separate hype from reality and understand the value of an MBA. While we got 
                             diverse responses, the responses can be broadly classified into the following themes: 
                        </p>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p>
                        In table-1 above, while individual categories are not a complete justification of the reason to pursue an MBA,
                        our respondents were motivated by a combination of these factors giving different weightage to each.

                        <h3>Good time to start preparing?</h3><p> While some start preparing as early as February, but an ideal time to start preparation is around the end of July. 
                            Most coaching institutes start crash-courses at this time designed specifically for IIT students. </p><br>
                        <h3>Best way to study?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The usual way of studying is learning the concepts and then giving practice tests. However, for CAT preparation, 
                                it is the other way around. Giving full mock tests and analysing them will provide an excellent picture of your 
                                present standing. Accordingly, you can focus on the type of questions which need attention. A much lengthier method 
                                of prep would be working on understanding and perfecting all theory first and then giving mock tests, which is not advisable.</li>
                            <li>Another way to improve your verbal and reading comprehension skills is to read a book a week. Force yourself to read a lot and then write a review, to make sure you understand what you have read.</li>
                            <li>Some tips for CAT preparation, Shubham Singhal from IIMA says:</li>

                        <br><img src="" alt="Infographic-3: Number of CAT attempts by surveyed IITB alumni admitted to Indian B-Schools" width=96%><br>
                        <p>Most people who were interviewed cleared the CAT in their first attempt, and many of those who took the test twice didn’t prepare seriously for their first attempt. 
                            Take away message, CAT is not very difficult for our college crowd, with some preparation you can certainly crack, if not ace the exam. </p>
                        <h3>What After CAT? </h3>
                        <h5>For IIMs</h5>
                        <p>Continuing the flow chart from ‘Everything about CAT section’:</p>
                        <br><img src="" alt="Flowchart-2" width=96%><br>
                        <p>Starting with Personal interview (PI): The interview panel are Professors of that B-school, and your CV is shortlisted by professors and sometimes even students of that school. 
                            Thus it is advisable to reach out to IITB alums in your targeted B-Schools to understand the shortlisting process. <br><br>
                            The panel looks for excellent ambassadors of their institute and mainly people who can add unique value to the student community. In the end, networking with a diverse 
                            set of people is one important offering of any B-School and they keep that in mind during the recruitment process. <br><br>
                            The kind of questions asked in the interview vary depending on the panel and the school, the panel may test your undergraduate interns, business and general awareness 
                            (typical IIMA style) or they may be interested in your work experience and personal interests (typical IIM B style).  
                        </p>
                        <h3>What is the best way to prepare for the PI? </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start by asking yourself some of the possible questions and answering them honestly; you can also make various buckets, namely academics, work experience, finance, 
                                current affairs, extracurriculars and personal characteristics for the same. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Reading newspapers and relevant web articles will help you keep yourself abreast of all the major current affairs which will also help in essays and group discussions, 
                                about which we’ll talk in the next paragraph ‘What before Personal Interviews’.</li>
                            <li>Considering the interview questions can also be based on what you’ve studied so far, Hamza Najmi from IIM Kozhikode advises (especially for freshers applying to B School), </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><img src="" alt="Quote" width=96%><br>
                        <h3>What before Personal Interviews?</h3>
                        <p>You’ll have your <strong>AWT (Analytical Writing Test: in IIM A)</strong> or the <strong>WAT (Written Ability Test: in other IIMs)</strong> a.k.a. </strong>The essays.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AWT and WAT fundamentally test how well you can present your thoughts in writing. In IIM A’s AWT, you will have to analyse a 3 paragraph newspaper-like article, and in the other IIMs WAT, you will have to write about a small topic which will be briefed in 2-3 lines for the sake of clarity.</li>
                            <li>You will be given 15-20 mins for the test. The focus of assessment here is how well you back your views up with your analysis and arguments. The language, while not expected to be flowery- should be grammatically correct (the basic hygiene). </li>
                            <li>Revati Rajput from IIMA says,</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><img src="" alt="Quote" width=96%><br>
                        <p>The above selection process is common across all major B-schools in India: IIMs, ISBs and XLRI. There are coaches (institutes) who can train you for this phase of the selection process. 
                            Coaching institutes like T.I.M.E and Career Launcher provide focussed training to students who have successfully reached this stage through mock interviews and mock AWT/WAT. <strong>
                            These coaching institutes also offer special workshops and fee discounts exclusively for IITians, giving us an edge over others.</strong><br><br>
                            Important to note that IIMs don’t have <strong>group discussion (GD)</strong> as a part of their selection process, but it is an integral part of the selection process of many other top B-schools like XLRI. It is an understated fact, but it is vital to keep your calm and put forth your arguments confidently. 
                            You can join <em>facebook preparation groups or make preparation groups with your friends for regular group discussions.</em>
