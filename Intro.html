                        <p> If you are a student/recent graduate who aspires to join the best Business Schools in India then 
                            this guide will be quite handy for you!

                            This guide is a product of a collaboration between Insight and an IIT B alumna, Prachi
                            Chavda, from the class of
                            2017. The conception of this guidebook has an interesting story behind it. If we may (we
                            won’t mind if you skip to the next paragraph :-) )
                            <br><br>
                                On 5th March 2020, a few days before the COVID-19 lockdown, Prachi was travelling for work, 
                                and her flight was delayed by a couple of hours. By some coincidence, a girl wearing an H10 
                                hoodie was sitting right next to her, so in order to kill time, they talked for hours. During 
                                the course of that conversation, Prachi realised how lost the sophomore was, like herself at 
                                that stage, not fully knowing the opportunities available in and after college or even whom to 
                                approach for guidance. Inspired to bridge the knowledge gap, Prachi decided to do her research. 
                                In May 2020, she reached out to Insight with this idea to pen down learnings from various alumni.

                            This guide focuses on Business Management Programs, mainly MBA since it is the most popular
                            management degree.
                            We plan to release the guide in two parts, the first part (this one) covers relevant
                            information regarding management
                            programs in India. We have covered eight schools - IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Bangalore, IIM
                            Calcutta, IIM Kozhikode,
                            IIM Indore, IIM Lucknow, ISB (Hyderabad and Mohali) and XLRI (Jamshedpur) for analysis and
                            interviews and FMS Delhi.
                            We will soon release the next part, extensively covering information about management
                            programs in foreign schools. We
                            have collected information from reliable online resources and reached out to 100+ IIT B
                            alumni from the listed B-Schools,
                            to make this mini-guide as diverse and credible as possible.

                    <br>
                    <p> If each of us asked ourselves why we chose IIT, many of us might answer <i>“my parents asked
                            (read: forced)
                            me to give JEE”</i> as we were very young and did not know any better. Approaching graduation,
                            most of us
                            face the ‘problem of plenty’ - accepting placement offers, applying for higher studies,
                            pursuing an MBA,
                            or doing something unconventional. While many options may exist, they fall into two broad
                            categories -
                            ‘research and academia’ or ‘the corporate path to success’. Suppose you do end up (whether
                            pre-planned or not) with
                            a job. In that case, it is highly probable that you would ask yourself these questions
                            sooner or later in life- <i>“should
                            I do a Management course or not?” and “should I give CAT/GMAT or not?”</i>.
                    
                        <br><br>
                        Quite often, people apply for IIMs after their graduation if they are not able to secure their
                        dream job in a
                        particular stream. Many believe that an MBA would boost their salary and enhance their chances
                        of pursuing the
                        profile that they desire. While this may be true to some extent, prior job experience greatly
                        helps in securing
                        an internship in a B-School. The summer placement, as it is called, is just five months into the
                        start of most
                        MBA programs. A fresher’s CV is judged mostly based on the UG CPI and previous internship(s)
                        experience. Moreover,
                        failing to secure the right internship during the MBA can hinder good placements later. Thus
                        freshers find it challenging
                        to secure top placements in most B-Schools, thus resulting in a cycle. Most alumni that we
                        contacted were against the
                        idea of joining a B-School just after graduation. When asked <b>“How many years of work
                            experience did you have before MBA?”
                            and “What according to you is the advisable number of years of pre-MBA work
                            experience?”</b>, (we plotted the answers as infographic-1) we can see that :

                        Looking at infographic-2, one might wonder why MBAs cost as much as they do, and why they are so
                        sought after
                        when most people could get a decent package after 2-3 years of job experience. We asked the same
                        to many IIT-B
                        alumni, and the answers helped us separate hype from reality and understand the value of an MBA.
                        While we got
                        diverse responses, the responses can be broadly classified into the following themes:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Changing profile</th>
                            <td>An MBA is an excellent opportunity to shift profiles in the middle of your career.
                                Be it a consulting job where you are
                                stuck in one vertical or a back-end job, or you may want to shift to front-end
                                client handling. While a shift in
                                verticals is possible by applying to different companies, MBA equips you with a
                                diverse set of skills which help you
                                adapt to the field even without the required experience.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Shift to the managerial role</th>
                            <td>IIT B being an engineering institute has an abundance of technical roles during
                                placements. People tend to lose interest
                                in these roles or want to shift to the middle or top management. However, the lack
                                of managerial experience restricts
                                their growth. An MBA is an excellent way to transition as the combination of
                                technical expertise with organisational
                                knowledge opens up many opportunities in consulting, FMCG, Finance, to name a few.

                        <tr>
                            <th>Networking</th>
                            <td>All MBA curriculums have a networking course. Doing an MBA helps you connect with a
                                peer group diverse in terms of
                                background, work experience, etc. Thus one gains new perspectives to the same
                                problem and is helpful in soft skill
                                development. The network that a person develops helps them even after their MBA. A
                                good network means that you can call
                                up your consult or finance friend for the project that you are working. This network
                                even helps in opening opportunities
                                if and when you need to move to new companies or sectors.</td>

                            <td>A special mention among the responses that we got from our survey is that ‘it would
                                be an opportunity to go back to the
                                college experience’. Undoubtedly an MBA is much more hectic as compared to an
                                undergraduate degree, due to a multitude
                                of assignments, case interviews, resume submissions, and so forth. But it provides a
                                break from the monotony of a 9 to 5
                                job. The opportunity to explore new branches and meet new people attracts people to
                                pursue an MBA.</td>

                    <p> MBA graduates are in great demand today. It is crucial to choose the right
                        business school to establish a successful career after an MBA. Most Indian MBA
                        candidates/aspirants are often confused between pursuing an MBA in India or abroad.
                        <br><br>
                        Here is a detailed comparison of pursuing an MBA in India vs an MBA abroad to help you make
                        sound decisions that can benefit your career in the long run.

                            <td>The key entrance exam for MBA in India is the Common Admission Test (CAT). Many top

                                prestigious IIMs accept CAT scores. Personal Interviews follow the written exam.
                                On the other hand, for taking admission in an MBA course at a foreign B-School,
                                candidates need to appear for GRE and
                                GMAT (preferred). These tests are conducted on a rolling basis and give an aspirant a

                                perspectives. You can get the chance to learn a new language, and interact with other

                                also become more independent and confident, broaden your horizons and help in

                                Rs. 75-95 lakh, depending on the
                                B-School you are admitted to. The living expenses abroad are also significantly higher
                                as compared to India, which
                                further increases the cost. Do keep in mind the ROI is similar for India and abroad.
