                        <p> When asked about the things they would change in their UG experience to increase their
                            selection chances, the alumni had
                            varying stances. While we have tried to incorporate people from all sorts of backgrounds, it
                            really depends on the
                            individual. But these suggestions hopefully will help increase your chances of selection in

                    <h3>3. IIM Calcutta</h3>
                    <p>IIM Calcutta is renowned for its finance specialisation. That is not to say that it lacks in its
                        other specialisations.
                        The top 3 IIMs, namely IIM A, B and C offer similar placement opportunities. They have an
                        equally good reputation in the
                        industry. The number of students in the batch is approximately 460.</p>
                    <p>The opportunities are similar across the top three IIMs. With IIM B eyeing primarily students
                        with work experience, you
                        as a fresh graduate will likely be deciding whether to choose IIM Ahmedabad or Calcutta.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rachil Maliwal</strong> who had job experience in Citi Bank decided to go to IIM C
                        because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, because Calcutta is the finance campus, with a large number of core finance roles
                            being offered.</li>
                        <li>Secondly, academic rigour in Ahmedabad is very intense. Attendance rules, daily class
                            preparation in Calcutta is
                            relatively relaxed.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, Ahmedabad admits students with impeccable academic records. Calcutta is a bit more
                            forgiving of students' past
                            mistakes. This also plays into your relative standing in the institute, and securing a good
                            internship becomes easier in
                            Calcutta than in Ahmedabad.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>One thing unique to IIM Calcutta is the <strong>PGD in Business Analytics</strong>, a course that
                        is jointly
                        offered by ISI, IIT
                        Kharagpur and IIM C; you can get to know more about the program through their <a

                    <p>Sure, IIMK is not seen at par with IIM A, B, C, Lucknow and ISB in terms of reputation and
                        opportunities by IIT
                        students. Still, being one of the older IIMs, its vast alumni network ensures excellent
                        placements which can’t be
                        called, “not good”, by any standards. The number of students in the batch is nearly 480.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IIMK has recently started attracting some leading private equity and multiple Alternate

                        <li>IIMK has always been renowned for the quality job offers in the marketing vertical. And on

                    <p><strong>Pratibha Ojwani</strong> from IIM L says, <i>“If you look at the NIRF(National
                            Institutional Ranking Framework) rating, IIM L is at
                            the 4th position, so it has got a good reputation. It is pretty good, but the proportion of
                            students from the top IITs
                            is small, which has its pros and cons though IITians are given special treatment here.”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is the 4th oldest IIM and most companies that go to ABC come to L too, so placement chances
                        are relatively better for
                        the same roles. The number of students in the batch is roughly 400.</p>

                        despite the fees of the
                        programme being least amongst these 8 B-schools. It also has the highest proportion of freshers

                    <p>Some pieces of the MBA programme that are unique to IIM I:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Experiential learning:</strong> Students visit a company once a week in the first
                            year of the Programme. They are required to
                            carry out a study on various industries and key players in the industry. This enhances their
                            exposure to organisations
                            and provides them with a backdrop for analysing the managerial contexts of different cases.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Unique rural immersion programme:</strong> To enable the participants to understand
                            the social context in which organisations
                            work and exist; exposure to the rural settings of Madhya Pradesh to give graduates
                            contextual connection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Himalayan outbound program:</strong> In the second year, there is an Himalayan
                            outbound program, which is a 2 credit course. It
                            involves trekking in the Himalayas.</li>

                    <p>The fee for the one year MBA program comes to around 33 – 35 lakhs. The intake capacity increased
                        significantly to more

                    <p>The intense one-year program has the core courses, electives as well as an opportunity to pursue

                        GMAT score is mandatory while applying to ISB. While there is no minimum score requirement, a
                        score above 700 is

                        which has relatively more IITians. The campus location is in Jamshedpur. XLRI offers

                                <p><strong>Gunish Handa</strong>, IIMA alumnus who opted for a deferral program
                                    (when he
                                    already had some months of work experience when he
                                    got selected at IIMA, i.e. 0-1 year eligibility) says, <i>“I think the committee
                                        expects
                                        the applicant to work in good
                                        places, and come to the program with considerable on-ground insights about
                                        various
                                        topics such as finance, strategy,
                                        operations etc. As far as I know, there is no negotiation. It is fixed,
                                        based on
                                        the
                                        amount of work experience that you
