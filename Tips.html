                            from all sorts of backgrounds, it really depends on the individual. But these suggestions
                            hopefully will help increase your chances of selection in Indian B-schools.</p> <br>

                            exams and still expect to get results.</p> <br>

                                applications for ‘in-semester internship’, also called as ‘live internship/projects’ for
                                first & second year students in the company/firm they work in. Students aiming to land
                                in marketing roles especially try to grab such interns and get as much exposure in
                                different firms, some students even do 4-5 in-sem/live internships in their 2 years at
                                IIM. These internships can pay/not pay subjective to the firm. Students try to grab
                                these opportunities as soon as they enter into IIM.</p> <br>

                                knowledge, but it’ll also be a valuable point in your resume. But make sure you do some
                                research on how to solve them instead of doing them the wrong way. Finance, marketing,
                                consult, analytics etc there are many good inter MBA school competitions within India as
                                well on international levels.</p> <br>
