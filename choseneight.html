                    <h3>1. IIM Ahmedabad</h3>
                    <p>IIM A has been the top-ranked MBA school in India and probably the most difficult to get a call
                        from and get admission
                        into. The cohort is younger compared to that of IIMB, with higher numbers of freshers in a
                        class, nearly 140
                        students(almost 35% of class) out of the class size of nearly 400 students.</p>
                    <p>If you want to understand admission criteria for IIMA (based on CAT 2020 results) you can check
                        out how they calculate
                        the cumulative score. It takes into account previous degree type, grades school, college and
                        work-experience <a
                            href="https://www.iima.ac.in/web/pgp/apply/domestic/admission/selection-process"
                            target="blank">here</a>.<strong> Each
                            institute gives different weights to different parameters. This information can be found on
                            their respective websites.
                            It is recommended that you check these parameters for your target schools to estimate your
                            chances of selection</strong>.</p>
                    <p>As per our interviews, we found that A is more academically rigorous than B and C. Some may say
                        it is better to be a big
                        fish in a small pond than a small fish in a larger one. Given the higher ranking of IIM A, it
                        attracts many highly
                        talented individuals which in turn means higher competition during placements. Thus, the same
                        person can get slightly
                        better placement opportunities at B and C because of marginally less competition.

                    <h3>2. IIM Bangalore</h3>
                    <p>Average work ex of students at IIM B is slightly higher than that of A since B is more inclined
                        to get candidates with
                        some work experience than A and C. Number of students in the batch is nearly 400. IIM-B uniquely
                        provides a student with
                        foreign opportunities compared to other IIMs that tend to have fewer placements abroad. IIM-B
                        has almost 5% foreign
                        placements, which may seem low, but when compared to other IIMs that have less than 1% foreign
                        placements, the
                        proportion is high for IIM-B.</p>
                    <p>Also, IIMB asks for two LORs and one SOP also at the time of admission, which is not asked by A
                        and C, the referencer
                        will have to give the information before the interview round. LOR can be from your employer or
                        professor: professors
                        will give good LORs. The advice here is to maintain good relationships with IIT professors.</p>
                    <p>IIMB has also started PGP in business Analytics this year, it is a 2 years program with batch
                        size of 46 people.</p><hr>

                    <h3>3. IIM Calcutta</h3>
                    <p>IIM Calcutta is renowned for its finance specialisation. That is not to say that it lacks in its
                        other specialisations.
                        The top 3 IIMs, namely IIM A, B and C offer similar placement opportunities. They have an
                        equally good reputation in the
                        industry. The number of students in the batch is approximately 460.</p>
                    <p>The opportunities are similar across the top three IIMs. With IIM B eyeing primarily students
                        with work experience, you
                        as a fresh graduate will likely be deciding whether to choose IIM Ahmedabad or Calcutta.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rachil Maliwal</strong> who had job experience in Citi Bank decided to go to IIM C
                        because:</p>

                    <p>One thing unique to IIM Calcutta is the <strong>PGD in Business Analytics</strong>, a course that
                        is jointly
                        offered by ISI, IIT
                        Kharagpur and IIM C; you can get to know more about the program through their <a

                    <p>Sure, IIMK is not seen at par with IIM A, B, C, Lucknow and ISB in terms of reputation and
                        opportunities by IIT
                        students. Still, being one of the older IIMs, its vast alumni network ensures excellent
                        placements which can’t be
                        called, <i>“not good”</i>, by any standards. The number of students in the batch is nearly 480.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IIMK has recently started attracting some leading private equity and multiple Alternate

                            Rohatyn Group and the Duff and Phelps, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and State Street
                            among others.</li>
                        <li>IIMK has always been renowned for the quality job offers in the marketing vertical. And on
                            top of that, the serene
                            campus nestled between the Arabian sea and the Western ghats won’t make you regret your 2
                            years stay even if you
                            couldn’t crack the sought after top IIMs or ISB.</li>

                    <p>It is the 4th oldest IIM and most companies that go to ABC come to L too, so placement chances
                        are relatively better for
                        the same roles. The number of students in the batch is roughly 400.</p><hr>

                        despite the fees of the
                        programme being least amongst these 8 B-schools. It also has the highest proportion of freshers
                        in their batch amongst
                        these top schools.</p>
                    <p>Some pieces of the MBA programme that are unique to IIM I:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Experiential learning:</strong> Students visit a company once a week in the first
                            year of the Programme. They are required to
                            carry out a study on various industries and key players in the industry. This enhances their
                            exposure to organisations
                            and provides them with a backdrop for analysing the managerial contexts of different cases.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Unique rural immersion programme:</strong> To enable the participants to understand
                            the social context in which organisations
                            work and exist; exposure to the rural settings of Madhya Pradesh to give graduates
                            contextual connection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Himalayan outbound program:</strong> In the second year, there is an Himalayan
                            outbound program, which is a 2 credit course. It
                            involves trekking in the Himalayas.</li>

                    <p>The fee for the one year MBA program comes to around 33 – 35 lakhs. The intake capacity increased
                        significantly to more
                        than 800 with its new campus at Mohali (functional since 2012) along with Hyderabad (more famous

                        Management (GM) MBA program
                        which has relatively more IITians. The campus location is in Jamshedpur. XLRI offers

                        and other B-schools, it
                        depends on which courses you choose. One of our alums in XLRI says “XLRI operations and
                        marketing placements are better
                        than others in terms of types and pay scale of companies which come for placements.” Cohorts for
                        GM (General Management
                        MBA Program) generally have 2 years of experience.</p>

                                eligible for deferral at IIM A, and
