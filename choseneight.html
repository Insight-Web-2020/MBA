                    <h3>1. IIM Ahmedabad</h3> <br>

                    <p>IIM A has been the top-ranked MBA school in India and probably the most difficult to get a call
                        from and get admission into. The cohort is younger compared to that of IIMB, with higher numbers
                        of freshers in a class, nearly 140 students(almost 35% of class) out of the class size of nearly
                        400 students.</p> <br>

                    <p>If you want to understand admission criteria for IIMA (based on CAT 2020 results) you can check
                        out how they calculate the cumulative score. It takes into account previous degree type, grades
                        school, college and work-experience
                        <a href="https://www.iima.ac.in/web/pgp/apply/domestic/admission/selection-process"
                            target="blank">here</a>. <strong> Each institute gives different weights to different
                            parameters. This information can be found on their respective websites. It is recommended
                            that you check these parameters for your target schools to estimate your chances of
                            selection</strong>.</p> <br>

                    <p>As per our interviews, we found that A is more academically rigorous than B and C. Some may say
                        it is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a larger one. Given the
                        higher ranking of IIM A, it attracts many highly talented individuals which in turn means higher
                        competition during placements. Thus, the same person can get slightly better placement
                        opportunities at B and C because of marginally less competition. <br><br>

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <blockquote> Talking about IIM-A, the stiff competition does nothing but enriches your experience.
                        Opportunities are not to be offered but created for yourself. As they say, if you can survive at
                        IIM-A, you can survive anywhere in the world.<footer>— Revati Rajput, IIMA</footer>

                    <h3>2. IIM Bangalore</h3> <br>

                    <p>Average work experience of students at IIM-B is slightly higher than that of A since B is more
                        inclined to get candidates with some work experience than A and C. Number of students in the
                        batch is nearly 400. IIM-B uniquely provides a student with foreign opportunities compared to
                        other IIMs that tend to have fewer placements abroad. IIM-B has almost 5% foreign placements,
                        which may seem low, but when compared to other IIMs that have less than 1% foreign placements,
                        the proportion is high for IIM-B.</p> <br>

                    <p>Also, IIM-B asks for two LORs and one SOP also at the time of admission, which is not asked by A
                        and C, the referencer will have to give the information before the interview round. LOR can be
                        from your employer or professor: professors will give good LORs. The advice here is to maintain
                        good relationships with IIT professors.</p> <br>

                    <p>IIM-B has also started PGP in business Analytics this year, it is a 2 years program with batch
                        size of 46 people.</p><br>

                    <h3>3. IIM Calcutta</h3> <br>

                    <p>IIM Calcutta is renowned for its finance specialisation. That is not to say that it lacks in its
                        other specialisations. The top 3 IIMs, namely IIM A, B and C offer similar placement
                        opportunities. They have an equally good reputation in the industry. The number of students in
                        the batch is approximately 460.</p> <br>

                    <p>The opportunities are similar across the top three IIMs. With IIM B eyeing primarily students
                        with work experience, you as a fresh graduate will likely be deciding whether to choose IIM
                        Ahmedabad or Calcutta.</p> <br>

                    <p><strong>Rachil Maliwal</strong> who had job experience in Citi Bank decided to go to IIM-C

                                <li> Firstly, because Calcutta is the finance campus, with a large number of finance
                                    roles being offered. </li>
                                <li> Secondly, academic rigour in Ahmedabad is very intense. Attendance rules, daily
                                    class preparation in Calcutta is relatively relaxed. </li>
                                <li> Lastly, Ahmedabad admits students with impeccable academic records. Calcutta is a
                                    bit more forgiving of students' past mistakes. This also plays into your relative
                                    standing in the institute, and securing a good internship becomes easier in Calcutta
                                    than in Ahmedabad.</li>

                            players in the industry. This enhances their exposure to organisations and provides them
                            with a backdrop for analysing the managerial contexts of different cases.

                        <p>The fee for the one year MBA program comes to around 33 – 35 lakhs. The intake capacity
                            increased
                            significantly to more than 800 with its new campus at Mohali (functional since 2012) along
                            with
                            Hyderabad (more famous and older).</p> <br>

                        <p>The intense one-year program has the core courses, electives as well as an opportunity to
                            pursue
                            areas of your interest under a faculty member under the ISP (Independent Study Programme).
                            ISB
                            only takes applicants with 2+ years’ experience. GMAT score is mandatory while applying to
                            ISB.
                            While there is no minimum score requirement, a score above 700 is considered very
                            impressive.

                    <h3>8. Xavier School of Management (XLRI)</h3> <br>

                    <p>XLRI is considered the best institute for HR studies in Asia, and it also offers a General
                        Management (GM) MBA program which has relatively more IITians. The campus location is in
                        Jamshedpur. XLRI offers specialisations in finance, operations, marketing, strategy, although in
                        the degree this is not mentioned, rather like IIMs and other B-schools, it depends on which
                        courses you choose. One of our alums in XLRI says “XLRI operations and marketing placements are
                        better than others in terms of types and pay scale of companies which come for placements.”
                        Cohorts for GM (General Management MBA Program) generally have 2 years of experience.</p> <br>

                                offered the admit, currently, in India, IIMA and ISB allows select eligible candidates
                                to defer their admission. Applicants have to give CAT and GMAT like standard
                                applications but those who have work experience less than one year are eligible for
                                deferral at IIMA, and last year students for ISB.</p> <br>

                            <p>Applicants have to give CAT like standard applications and selected in the interviews and
                                be offered an admit like normal. Once you get admission results, you can contact the
                                admission committee for a deferral, and if your application is approved, then you are
                                good to go. So if your deferral request is accepted then you need NOT give CAT again and
                                should work for 1 or 2 years before eventually joining the MBA program.</p> <br>
